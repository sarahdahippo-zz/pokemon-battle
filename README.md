# Pokemon-Battle
A mini Pokemon Battle game with a GUI implemented with JavaFX. There are still features that can be added.

## Optimization
Since this is my first attempt with JavaFX, there are many improvements I can make for future projects:
- Break the large class size into smaller classes
- Break the large functions into smaller, more specific methods
- Make use of separate methods and loops to reduce duplicated code
- Rename variables to be more meaningful (eg. the buttons)
